# Change audio playback speed online – free, fast & private

Adjust the playback speed of MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG and more directly in your browser. Slow a song for practice, speed up long lectures, or reverse audio for creative sound design — no signup, no watermark, no file uploads. Everything processes locally for maximum privacy.

## Why use our audio playback speed editor?

- **100% private:** WebAssembly runs fully in-browser. Nothing leaves your device.
- **Reverse + ±20× range:** Precise slider control from -20× (reverse) up to +20×.
- **Pitch handling:** Maintain pitch (time‑stretch) or allow natural chipmunk/deep effects (future toggle).
- **Multiple formats:** MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG and other common codecs.
- **Instant preview:** Hear speed changes immediately before exporting.
- **No installs:** Pure browser app — desktop & mobile friendly.
- **Free forever:** No paywalls, accounts or branding.

## How it works

1. **Upload audio** (drag & drop or click).  
2. **Adjust speed / direction** with the slider (negative = reverse).  
3. **Preview instantly** and fine‑tune tempo.  
4. **Download processed file** with applied speed/reverse effect.  

## Key features

- **Wide speed range:** -20× to +20× for creative flexibility.  
- **Reverse mode:** Negative speed values generate reversed playback.  
- **Format agnostic:** Works across compressed and lossless formats.  
- **Non-destructive preview:** Original file untouched until export.  
- **Privacy-first architecture:** No server queue or tracking pixels.  
- **Lightweight UI:** Minimal latency for iterative practice sessions.  
- **Mobile optimized:** Touch-friendly slider & controls.  

## Advanced use cases

| Persona | Use Case | Benefit |
| ------- | -------- | ------- |
| Musician | Slow solo sections | Improve accuracy & phrasing |
| Podcaster | Accelerate raw takes | Faster editing workflow |
| Student | Speed lectures to 1.5–2× | Save study time |
| Language learner | Slow dialogue | Better comprehension |
| Sound designer | Reverse & extreme stretch | Unique SFX |
| Content creator | Match clip timing | Sync to video pacing |

## Tips for best results

- Keep moderate changes (0.75×–1.5×) for speech clarity.  
- Extreme slowdowns may introduce artifacts (expected with phase vocoding).  
- Reverse first, then process with other effects (if chaining tools).  
- Export WAV for lossless editing, MP3 for distribution.  

## Troubleshooting

**Playback sounds warped?** Very large speed shifts can cause phasing; try a smaller increment.  
**Reverse export silent?** Ensure you waited for full processing before downloading.  
**Large file stalls?** Close other heavy tabs to free memory.  

## FAQs

### How do I reverse audio?
Set the speed slider below 0 (e.g. -1×). The tool processes a reversed version and lets you preview before download.

### Will changing speed affect pitch?
Current implementation couples speed & pitch (classic resample). A pitch‑preserve (time‑stretch) toggle is on the roadmap.

### Are my audio files uploaded anywhere?
No. Processing uses WebAssembly locally; files never leave your device.

### What formats are supported?
Most common formats (MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG) plus any container FFmpeg WASM can decode in the browser context.

### Can I loop a slowed section?
Not yet. A loop & segment practice mode is planned to aid musicians.

### What’s the maximum speed?
Currently +20× forward and -20× for reverse; beyond that gains diminish and artifacts dominate.

### Why does extreme slowdown sound grainy?
Time stretching beyond ~4× exposes transient smearing — inherent to the algorithm; export WAV for best fidelity.

### Does it work on mobile browsers?
Yes — optimized for modern Chromium, Safari and Firefox mobile builds.

### Is there a file size limit?
Only what your browser memory can handle. Larger FLAC/WAV files may require closing other tabs.

### Is it really free with no watermark?
Yes. No watermarking, tracking, or gated features.

## Blog guide – how to change audio speed online

### Why adjust audio speed?
Practice efficiency, content repurposing, accessibility, creative inversion (reverse), time budget optimization and pacing alignment for video or narration.

### Step-by-step tutorial
1. Upload your file.  
2. Move the speed slider (negative for reverse).  
3. Preview — iterate until satisfied.  
4. Download in preferred format.  

### Best use cases
- **Practice drills:** Loop & slow tough measures (future loop enhancement).  
- **Podcast editing:** Fast skim at 1.75× to mark edit points.  
- **Creative FX:** Reverse risers, slow impacts, quick stutters (export multiple variants).  
- **Education:** Speed lecture audio to compress study time.  

### Conclusion
You can manipulate, reverse and repurpose audio entirely in the browser without installing software or exposing private files. Precise speed control accelerates learning, creation and editing — all while staying private and free.
