## Effect guidance (recommended ranges)

| Effect     | Typical Range        | Practical Tips |
|----------- |----------------------|----------------|
| **Pitch**  | –7 to +7 semitones   | Beyond ±12 can sound artificial; great for key matching. |
| **Speed**  | 0.5× to 2×           | Large stretches may impact quality; preview before exporting. |
| **Fade**   | 0.5–3 s              | Longer fades fit ambient/lo‑fi tracks; shorter for speech. |
| **Normalize** | –1 dB peak (guide) | Normalize before adding gain to avoid clipping. |

---

## Popular tasks & use cases

- **Change key of a song online** for karaoke or guitar practice.  
- **Slow down music** without re‑recording; rehearse tricky sections.  
- **Speed up long recordings** to shorten podcasts or lectures.  
- **Normalize multiple tracks** for a consistent listening experience.

## FAQs

### Is it really free and private?
Yes. The editor runs completely in your browser using WebAssembly — **no uploads, accounts, or watermarks**.

### Can I change pitch and speed together?
Yes — pitch (semitones) and speed (tempo multiplier) can be adjusted in the same session. (Independent pitch/time‑stretch modes are on the roadmap.)

### Which formats are supported?
Common compressed and lossless files your browser can decode: **MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG, M4A**.

### What’s a safe range for pitch & speed?
Keep within **±7 semitones** for natural tone (±12 for stylized effects). For speed, **0.5×–2×** covers most practice and content needs.

### How do I avoid clipping or distortion?
Normalize first, then add volume gain. Leave **~1 dB headroom** to prevent peaks from clipping.

## Best practices & tips

- **Order of operations**: Normalize → Volume → Pitch/Speed → Fades → Export.  
- **Practice mode**: Slow to **0.75× or 0.8×** for instrument training; pitch down/up a few semitones for comfort.  
- **Podcast workflow**: Normalize to a consistent level, apply light gain, add quick fade in/out.  
- **Export choices**: **MP3 192–320 kbps** for general use; **WAV/FLAC** for editing or archiving.
