# Free online video compressor — fast, private, and watermark-free

Shrink MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, and WebM without sacrificing visual clarity. All compression runs locally in your browser (WebAssembly FFmpeg), so your files never upload to a server. Fine-tune **CRF**, **bitrate**, **resolution**, **frame rate**, and **preset speed** to hit exact size or quality targets.

> **Why this tool?**
> - **Private by design** — in-browser processing, no uploads or watermarks.  
> - **Advanced controls** — CRF, bitrate caps, preset speed, scaling, and FPS.  
> - **Great quality at small sizes** — sensible defaults plus expert tips.  
> - **Multi-format support** — MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, WebM.  
> - **Totally free** — no login, instant downloads.

## How it works
1. **Upload** a video (MP4/MOV/MKV/AVI/WebM).  
2. Pick **CRF** (quality) or set a **target bitrate** / size.  
3. (Optional) **Downscale** resolution or **reduce FPS**.  
4. Choose a **preset** (slower = smaller file, faster = quicker results).  
5. Click **Compress** and **download** your optimized video.

## Recommended settings (quick picks)
| Goal | Suggested Settings |
| --- | --- |
| Best quality for size | H.264, **CRF 19–21** (1080p) or **CRF 24–26** (4K) |
| Smallest acceptable | **CRF 24–28** + downscale to **1080p/720p** |
| Fast result | **fast/veryfast** preset + **CRF ~22–24** |
| Social uploads | 1080p **CRF 20–23** (YouTube), 1080×1920 30fps **CRF 23–25** (Reels/TikTok) |
| Email sharing | 720p **CRF 26–28**, consider 30→24/20 fps |

## Platform-specific tips
- **YouTube:** 1080p H.264, CRF **20–22**; prefer higher presets only if time-constrained.  
- **Instagram / TikTok:** 1080×1920, 24–30 fps, CRF **23–25**; trim dead air to save size.  
- **WhatsApp / Email:** Aim for **25 MB** or below; downscale to **720p**, CRF **26–28**.  
- **Discord / Telegram:** If there’s an upload cap, use “**Target file size**” (e.g., 8–25 MB) and adjust CRF accordingly.

## Feature highlights
- **CRF control** for perceptual quality and efficient bitrates.  
- **Preset speed slider** — trade time vs. compression ratio.  
- **Resolution scaler** — 4K → 1080p/720p/480p/custom.  
- **Bitrate management** — stay under strict caps for email/messaging.  
- **Instant download** — no re-upload loop, no watermark.

## Step-by-step guide: compress MP4 online (free)
1. Upload your MP4 and preview playback.  
2. Start with **CRF 20** (1080p) or **CRF 24** (4K).  
3. Choose **slower** preset for maximum savings, **fast/veryfast** for speed.  
4. If size is still large, **downscale** or drop FPS from **60→30**.  
5. Export and download immediately.

## CRF vs. bitrate: which should I use?
- **CRF** targets a consistent perceived quality. Files vary in size but look good; ideal for general use.  
- **Bitrate / target size** enforces a cap (useful for email/platform limits). For best results, pick a **slightly higher** bitrate than the minimum cap and let CRF handle quality.

## FAQs
### Is compression private?
Yes. Everything happens locally in your browser via WebAssembly FFmpeg. Your video never leaves your device.

### What video formats are supported?
MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, and WebM. Export is MP4 (H.264 + AAC) for broad compatibility.

### What CRF value should I start with?
Try **CRF 20–22** for 1080p, **CRF 24–26** for 4K. Lower CRF = higher quality and larger files.

### Why is 4K compression slower?
4× the pixels means more macroblocks to encode. Use **slower** preset for better ratios, or **downscale** for speed.

### Does lowering FPS help?
Yes. Reducing 60 → 30 fps can significantly cut size for non-action footage.

### Can I keep original resolution?
Absolutely. Skip scaling and tweak **CRF**/**bitrate** only.

### Any file size limits?
Only device memory/browser constraints. Close heavy tabs when processing very large files.

### Is it really free with no watermark?
Yes. No signup or watermark—just compress and download.

## Troubleshooting
- **Looks blocky?** Lower CRF (e.g., 27 → **23**).  
- **Still too large?** Increase CRF or **downscale** to 1080p/720p.  
- **Encoding feels slow?** Use a **faster preset** or reduce resolution/FPS.

## Blog section: pro tips for creators & teams
- **Keep audio efficient**: AAC **128 kbps** is usually transparent for talk shows/podcasts.  
- **Meet platform caps**: When a service enforces **MB limits**, use target size + CRF sanity checks.  
- **Archive smart**: Keep a high-quality master, distribute compressed copies.  
- **Web delivery**: Align resolution with player size; don’t ship 4K to a 720p embed.  
- **Consistency**: Document house presets (e.g., “1080p, CRF 21, slower”).
