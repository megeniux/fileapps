# Compress videos online – free, private & high quality

Shrink MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI and WebM files without sacrificing visual clarity. All compression runs locally with WebAssembly so your footage never uploads. Fine‑tune CRF, bitrate, resolution, frame rate and presets to hit exact size targets.

## Why use this video compressor?
- **Local processing:** No server queue or privacy risk.  
- **Advanced controls:** CRF, bitrate caps, preset speed & scaling.  
- **Quality retention:** Intelligent parameter guidance to prevent blockiness.  
- **Multi-format:** Handles common containers and codecs.  
- **Free & watermark-free:** Export production assets instantly.  

## How it works
1. Upload your source video.  
2. Choose CRF or target bitrate approach.  
3. (Optional) Downscale resolution / change FPS.  
4. Run compression (local FFmpeg WASM).  
5. Download optimized file.  

## Key features
- **CRF & bitrate hybrid strategy** suggestions (future inline hints).  
- **Preset speed tuning** for compression efficiency vs time.  
- **Resolution scaler** 4K → 1080p/720p/480p/custom.  
- **Bitrate management** for strict platform caps.  
- **Instant download** no re‑upload cycle.  
- **Cross‑device support** desktop & mobile.  

## Optimization scenarios
| Goal | Recommended Settings |
| ---- | -------------------- |
| Preserve quality | H.264 CRF 19–21 or H.265 CRF 24–26 |
| Smallest acceptable | H.264 CRF 24–28 + downscale |
| Fast result | Higher preset (fast/veryfast) + moderate CRF |
| Social upload | 1080p or 720p + CRF 22–25 |
| Email sharing | 720p + CRF 26–28, lower FPS if needed |

## FAQs
### How does compression remain private?
All encoding runs locally with WebAssembly; no file leaves your browser.

### What is CRF vs bitrate?
CRF targets perceptual quality; bitrate enforces a fixed data rate. CRF usually yields better size/quality balance for general use.

### Should I use H.265 instead of H.264?
H.265 can reduce size further but is slower to encode and less universally supported on older devices.

### Can I keep original resolution?
Yes—skip scaling and only adjust CRF / bitrate to reduce file size.

### Why is 4K compression slow?
Higher pixel count means more macroblocks to process; try downscaling or faster preset.

### Does lowering FPS help?
Yes, dropping from 60 → 30 can meaningfully reduce size for non‑action content.

### Any file size limit?
Only constrained by device memory; close other heavy tabs for very large sources.

### Is there a watermark or signup?
No watermark, no account—fully free.

## Blog guide – how to compress videos online
### Why compress video?
Faster uploads, platform limits, storage conservation, streaming efficiency, improved sharing and archival optimization.

### Step-by-step
1. Upload.  
2. Choose CRF (start 20) or set bitrate target.  
3. Downscale if resolution overkill.  
4. Pick preset (slower = smaller file).  
5. Compress & download.  

### Social platform tips
- **YouTube:** 1080p CRF 20–22 H.264 / consider VP9 for higher efficiency.  
- **Instagram/TikTok:** 1080×1920 30fps CRF 23–25.  
- **Messaging/Email:** 720p CRF 26–28.  

### Troubleshooting
**Looks blocky:** Lower CRF (e.g. 27 → 23).  
**Too large still:** Increase CRF or enable downscale.  
**Slow encode:** Use a faster preset or reduce resolution.  

### Conclusion
Controlled local compression delivers lean files without surrendering privacy or clarity—perfect for creators, educators and professionals.
